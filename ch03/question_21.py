# TODO: 21 (Calculate Change Using Fewest Number of Coins) Write a script
#  that inputs a purchase price of a dollar or less for an item. Assume the
#  purchaser pays with a dollar bill. Determine the amount of change the
#  cashier should give back to the purchaser. Display the change using the
#  fewest number of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. For example, if the
#  purchaser is due 73 cents in change, the script would output:
#  Your change is:
#  2 quarters 2 dimes 3 pennies
