# TODO: 20 (Binary-to-Decimal Conversion) Input an integer containing 0s and 1s (i.e., a “binary” integer) and
#  display its decimal equivalent. The online appendix, “Number Systems,” discusses the binary number system. [Hint:
#  Use the modulus and division operators to pick off the “binary” number’s digits one at a time from right to left.
#  Just as in the decimal number system, where the rightmost digit has the positional value 1 and the next digit to
#  the left has the positional value 10, then 100, then 1000, etc., in the binary number system, the rightmost digit
#  has the positional value 1, the next digit to the left has the positional value 2, then 4, then 8, etc. Thus,
#  the decimal number 234 can be interpreted as 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 1. The decimal equivalent of binary 1101 is 1
#  * 8 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 1.]
