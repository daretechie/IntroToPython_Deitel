# TODO: 15 (Sort in Ascending Order) Write a script that inputs three different floating-point numbers from the user.
#  Display the numbers in increasing order. Recall that an if statementâ€™s suite can contain more than one statement.
#  Prove that your script works by running it on all six possible orderings of the numbers. Does your script work
#  with duplicate numbers? [This is challenging. In later chapters youâ€™ll do this more conveniently and with many
#  more numbers.]

num1 = float(input('Enter the first floating number: '))
num2 = float(input('Enter the second floating number: '))
num3 = float(input('Enter the third floating number: '))

if num1 > num2:
    num1, num2 = num2, num1
if num2 > num3:
    num2, num3 = num3, num2
    if num1 > num2:
        num1, num2 = num2, num1

print(num1, ',', num2, ',', num3)
